A library for converting output from the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health and converting it into data usable by Wikidata.

Not all of NIOSHTIC is suitable for Wikidata, so this library should include features for sorting throug a "graylist" of possibly acceptable values, as well as a "blacklist" of rejected items.
